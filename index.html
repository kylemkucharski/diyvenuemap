      <p>The city that never sleeps needs a little pick-me-up after it was found that New York had lost 15 percent of its music venues in the past two decades.<br><br> Last year, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment released a comprehensive study
        on the city’s music industry. The report revealed that New York City’s music venues were vanishing at an alarming rate. The same report also noted that together the music and nightlife industry brings in $21 billion for the city, making a business
        once stigmatized, legitimate. Now, policymakers are stepping in to save New York’s small music venues. But in times of rapid development and high rent blight, will their efforts be enough?<br><br> “We rarely get to play a DIY space twice,” said
        Jon Ehlers, who makes up half of Bangladeafy, a Brooklyn-based prog-rock band. “They’re very important but sadly come and go.”<br><br>DIY spaces, formerly known as underground venues, are among the most popular spaces for today’s independent artists
        and musicians.<br><br></p>

        Although underground venues only make up 4 percent of the city’s music venues, the city recognizing these spaces is historic.<br><br> In the past year, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the New
        York City Council have created an Office Of Nightlife and launched CreateNYC, New York’s first-ever cultural plan.<br><br> In March, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment announced that former club owner Ariel Palitz would be New York’s
        first-ever Night Mayor. The role is designed to serve as a liaison between venues, residents, city officials and law enforcement.<br><br> “She has experience in many of the facets of nightlife, from running a successful nightclub for ten years
        to serving on her local community board,” says Janet Allon of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment about Palitz. <br><br> Allon said that the city hopes these recent efforts, like creating an Office of Nightlife, will help bolster New
        York’s smaller venues that hold 500 people or less. <br><br> “Small music venues are incubators of talent, and are places where up-and-coming musicians and other performers can hone their craft,” said Allon. <br><br> But only time will tell if
        the city’s efforts will be effective. <br><br> “You have all these people who put their hopes and dreams into their businesses, and they get shut down because of antiquated regulations,” says Benny Soto, the venue owner of Output, an underground
        electronic music venue in Brooklyn.<br><br> <b>(Graphic?)</b>
        <br><br> As the city continues to rapidly develop, owners like Soto express it’s a challenge to keep up a space, especially when there is little communication between spaces and the city. <br><br> “For so long, there hasn’t been a dialogue between
        the city and venues,” says Soto. <br><br> However, Soto says he is optimistic about the city recognizing the nightlife and music industry, a facet of New York that has been left in the shadows for well over a century. <br><br> “Back in the day
        a lot of nightlife and music venues were run by shadowy figures. Now it’s changed. It’s a billion-dollar industry,” says Soto. <br><br> Running any kind of business in New York can be challenging, but for DIY spaces, breaking even just to keep
        their doors open is often good enough.<br><br> “[They] are run by people who aren’t really in it for the money, but rather being a part of a thriving culture while hopefully being able to pay their bills,” Ehler said.
